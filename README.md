# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction â€” Portuguese Bank

This project predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their profile and past marketing interactions. It uses a real-world dataset from a Portuguese bank marketing campaign and applies end-to-end machine learning techniques, including preprocessing, SMOTE, XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning, SHAP explainability, and deployment preparation.
